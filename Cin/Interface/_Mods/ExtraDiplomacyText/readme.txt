EXTRA DIPLOMACY TEXT
////////////////////

INSTALLATION:

Simply put the "LRDT" folder into C:\User\Documents\My Games\Sid Meier's Civilization 5\MODS

When you load up the game, go to the Mod Database and hit "Installed". There should be a button that says "Install Mods".

Hit the Install Mods button, let it wait, and then check your installed mods list again.

"Extra Diplomacy Text" should be available now. Enable it by clicking the circle next to the name, and hit "Start Game" and you're ready to go!

This mod should be compatible with almost every other mod. It will not be compatible with mods that change AI diplomacy text files, like this one does.


TROUBLESHOOTING:

This is my first upload, so if the directions are wrong, then let me know, please.
If the above fails, or if you have any questions, please contact me on the "Extra Diplomacy Text" thread on civfanatics.com.
