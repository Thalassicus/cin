=== Communitas Project ===

The project has several parts:

	Communitas Map
	This map creates several continents with realistic climate, and numerous offshore islands.

	Communitas AI and Tools (CAT)
	This includes a broad variety of tools useful for mod authors, and expands the AI.
	Both the expansion pack and interface changes below require the tools.

	Communitas Interface (CIN) (This mod)
	Improves the visual interface of the game. This will be cross-compatible between all expansions. 

	Communitas Expansion Pack (CEP)
	Improves the fun and strategic balance of Civ V: Brave New World gameplay.
